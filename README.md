# Project-Human-Resources
A classification model using logistic regression to check which employee will leave the organization next using working hours, salary, last evaluation and other details of the employees left previously.

Problem:
Why are our best and most experienced employees leaving prematurely? Use this database and try to predict which valuable employees will leave next. Fields in the dataset include:

Employee satisfaction level,
Last evaluation,
Number of projects,
Average monthly hours,
Time spent at the company,
Whether they have had a work accident,
Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years,
Department,
Salary,
Whether the employee has left

We have two datasets , hr_train.csv and hr_test.csv . Use data hr_train to build predictive model for response variable ‘left’. hr_test data contains all other factors except “left”, we need to predict that using the model that we developed and save the predicted values in a csv files.
